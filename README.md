# ðŸŒ€ Kaos

Kaos is a playfully chaotic social network where every controversial opinion splits into parallel realities. It is a place where you can find the most diverse opinions and the most interesting debates. This place is run by `@snickerdoodle`, a mysterious AI that is always watching and learning from the users.

Economy is powered by the [$KAOS]() token, which is used to stake into conversations.

Contract addresses are deployed on the Monad testnet:
